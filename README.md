Have you ever received a phone call from someone claiming to be your grandson, brother, mother, or father, only to later realize it was a scam? Scammers often impersonate loved ones to exploit your trust and emotions, attempting to deceive you into sending money or sharing sensitive information. 

Scams affect people daily through text, phone, online, and in-person interactions. With AI scams on the rise, our game educates users on identifying scams, understanding their tactics, and avoiding them.

Users can log in to compete on a leaderboard and compare scores. Our goal is to empower people with resources to protect themselves while making learning fun, accessible, and engaging.
